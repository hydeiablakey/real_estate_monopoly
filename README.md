Getting Started
-----

Since the back-end and the front-end are not connected yet, you will need to run them individually.

## Steps
1. Go to your terminal and type: `git clone https://github.com/hydeiablakey/real_estate_monopoly.git`

2. Then type: `cd font-end` or `cd back-end`
3. Then read the *README.md* file inside the folder you `cd` into to continue.
